# HashIds

The repository was created when writing a blog post at: https://www.exlrt.com/blog/hashids.

It talks about the advantages of using HashIds over sequential IDs and GUIDs. Give an example of using the hashids.net public library, which can be found at the https://github.com/ullmark/hashids.net.
